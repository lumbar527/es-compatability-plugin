 	description "The Hai designed this weapon to best complement their Flea drones. Each Hai Railgun provides a significant amount of force upon firing, pushing the Flea drone backwards and therefore forcing it to keep its distance from its target."
 	description "	Flea drone pilots joke that they provide more thrust than engines of similar size, so Unfettered should be using them at the back of their ships. There's probably a cultural component to the joke that many miss, because it's told quite often and the Hai laugh hysterically about it - every time."
